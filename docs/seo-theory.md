Core mechanical principles
Topical authority is just clicks in a topic space. Google sees you getting clicks for keywords in a topic → you gain credibility in that topic. Expand your topic footprint → expand your authority footprint. No mystical mapping needed.
PageRank operates at page level, not domain level. Each page accumulates its own authority, relevancy, and signal graph. Your domain provides a baseline, but individual pages compete. This explains why keyword cannibalisation happens—multiple pages from one domain can block each other.
Topics overlap through "topical bridges." If people who search one query commonly search another, there's a bridge whether you acknowledge it or not. You can stretch into adjacent topics by linking and writing in the direction you want to expand.
What actually matters
User behaviour trumps content quality. Google doesn't read content like a human and award points for craftsmanship. It ranks by utility measured through external signals: clicks, links, time spent, mouse movements, repeat interactions. The system rewards the echo of quality, not quality in isolation.
Backlinks are real-world endorsements. They're proof someone pointed at your page and said "this is worth directing others to." Clicks work the same way—a vote with time and attention attached. Together they create a workable proxy for trust.
Links that send engaged traffic matter most. Contextual links are valuable only if they deliver visitors who stick around. External links sending traffic that behaves well is the single most important ranking factor beyond content itself.
Practical implications for Good Faith Labs
Focus on tight topical clusters. Each piece of content that gets clicks in these spaces mechanically builds your authority.
Internal linking strategy matters immensely. Like Wikipedia or major media sites, distribute link juice across your pages through strategic internal linking. Don't leave pages isolated.
Above-the-fold quality is critical. Everything important must appear at the beginning—this matches both how Google evaluates pages and how visitors actually read.
Track GSC positions 9-20. These are your topical authority expansion opportunities—keywords where you have some credibility but need to strengthen signals.
Metrics like DA/DR are approximations. You can lose backlinks whilst shipping content in a tight topical band and still see traffic and DA rise, because the tools interpret increased traffic within a topic as authority gain.
The fundamental takeaway: SEO is a mechanical system that can be reasoned about through observation. Forget content appreciation—focus on relevance, consistent publishing within your topical space, and earning links that show someone found the work valuable.
